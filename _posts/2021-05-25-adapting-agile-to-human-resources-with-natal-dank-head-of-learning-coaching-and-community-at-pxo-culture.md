Adopting agile can mean sweeping organizational change. Teams remove themselves from silos and re-focus with an intense focus on customer value and iterative design. This shift to agile will inevitably change many departments within an organization. In today's podcast, I talk to Natal Dank, co-author of Agile HR, and we talk about the future of Human Resources, and the benefits agile can bring.
