In today’s Agile in Action podcast, I speak with Jose Levy, Director of Cloud Services at OnePlan. We discuss the importance portfolio management processes and software still play in today’s modern organization.

In this podcast, he explains that as organizations embrace agile, leaders must recognize that not every project will use agile techniques. Further, not all teams will use the same applications to manage those projects. Different teams and functions in an organization can coexist on the agile spectrum while working towards a common objective.
