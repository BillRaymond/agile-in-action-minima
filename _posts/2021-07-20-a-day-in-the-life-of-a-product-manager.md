Leadership may define business goals, but how does your product strategy align? Enter the role of a Product Manager. Product Managers identify the strategic objectives and plans for a product and ensure they align closely with leadership's business goals. Today, I speak to Albert Chen, a Senior Product Manager at Okta and an organizer at the San Francisco chapter of ProductTank. Albert shares his view of the role of a Product Manager, where they belong in the corporate structure, the deliverables they produce, and how they are going about defining markets.
