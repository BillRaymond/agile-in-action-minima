Business agility represents the continuous and purposeful change you make to deliver more value to your customers and gain a competitive edge. Very often, we use frameworks that guide how to be more agile.  
The list of frameworks is endless and full of acronyms, like SCRUM, XP, SaFe, and many more. It can be tempting to select a framework that looks good and start using it. However, there are downsides to that approach.

In today's podcast, I speak with Evan Leybourn, Co-founder and CEO of the Business Agility Institute. We talk about why agility can increase revenues, improve team performance, and retain employees. Evan shares the approach you should take to define what agility means to your organization and balance that with the various frameworks available to you.
