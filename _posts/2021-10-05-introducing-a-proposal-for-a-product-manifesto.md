In today's podcast, I have a lively discussion with David Pereira, Head of Product at Virtual Identity, who makes a bold proposal for a Product Manifesto.

David shares that while the Manifesto for Agile Software Development helped us change how we work, we now need a product manifesto to define how we deliver value.
