Have you ever opened up an app that you love, just to be bothered by that one critical feature that hardly works, feels too slow, or is just frustrating to use? Chances are, the developers that wrote that code are all too aware of the problem. Maybe the code is too complex to fix without re-writing it, or perhaps their priorities shift to some other newer and shinier feature of the product. We call problems like this technical debt, and it is a growing problem that we must address.

In today's podcast, I speak with Alex Omeyer, Co-founder and CEO of Stepsize. Alex walks us through the various types of technical debt teams can accumulate. We then talk about how technical debt can impact teams, morale, and the customer's end product.

Alex proposes solutions to drive down technical debt by incorporating it directly into the development lifecycle. His organization, Stepsize, makes it easier to track technical debt and provide traceability, so the process ties directly into the standard tools developers use daily.
