Organizations that want to be more agile will often create small, autonomous teams that can deliver faster. The structure for those teams often looks similar to those defined by SCRUM. However, what happens when many SCRUM teams, maybe 20, 30, or more, need to work on coordinated release efforts? That is a problem the Scaled Agile Framework (or SAFe) may need to answer.

In today's podcast, I speak with Sander Dur, Agile Coach, SCRUM Trainer, Licensed SAFe Trainer, and the Podcast host at "Mastering Agility". Sander will walk you through a lightweight conversation of what SAFe is, introducing some of the differences between SAFe and SCRUM, and then we talk about what it means to move toward agility.
