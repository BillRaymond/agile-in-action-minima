Agile teams often think differently than more traditional project planning efforts. Gone are months-long project schedules with tasks, milestones, and resource plans. In place of that are autonomous teams that define a value-driven backlog of work, and they schedule that work in short iterations (or sprints) over 1-4 weeks.

Those teams will estimate the work and determine what can be done based on value and capacity for the upcoming iteration. Rather than detail the hours the teams work, they plan with story points.

But what exactly are story points, and how do they support planning efforts? That is what Mike Cohn shares in today's podcast.
