In today's podcast, I speak with Glenn Gow, The CEO Therapist and a CEO Coach. If your organization is unclear about its intended objectives, you will not achieve alignment. That misalignment can have tangible costs, such as not meeting revenue targets, reduced customer value, or reduced employee satisfaction. Glenn shares how CEOs and senior leaders should define measurable Objectives and Key Results. Glenn also shares how to align the organization to those OKRs and ensure accountability.
