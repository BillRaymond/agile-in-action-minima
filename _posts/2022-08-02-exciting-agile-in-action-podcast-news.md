## Transcript

_(transcripts are auto-generated, so please excuse the brevity)_

Hi, this is Bill Raymond. It is August 2nd, 2022, and I am excited to make a few announcements. The first and most important announcement is that we have grown to over 10,000 listeners.

Thank you!

I want to thank the team who helps deliver a quality podcast every week. And of course, I want to thank you, our listener. We hope to continue providing you with a podcast that is valuable for your personal career growth and helps people in organizations think differently about how we work and interact with each other.

A big milestone!

Another exciting announcement that I want to share with you is that we are celebrating our two year anniversary this month. I created the Agile in Action with Bill Raymond podcast because the terms agile and agility can mean many things. And many people think that agile is a term used for software development and indeed the roots of that specific term come from that community. When you listen to this podcast, you will almost certainly hear from people in the software community, but you will also hear how agile concepts run across many different disciplines. 

You can hear James Plunkett at Citizens Advice. Talk about agile for government policy development.  I have also interviewed Andrea Fryrear, as we talk about agile for marketing, and Loreal Jiles, who shares the benefits of adopting agile techniques in finance organizations. Agile and agility is a movement that continues to build steam in the workplace. Organizations that recognize the value in small teams, building great things are the ones that will benefit the most. And I want to help you understand how that works in practice. 

Of course smaller, more autonomous teams are just one component of the change required to implement agility. Teams need to thrive in the workplace, which is why Dr. Tracy Browers shares her ideas on that very same topic. Linda Varrell talks about dealing with ambiguity in the workplace. And just recently Alla Weinberg shares how you can create a place of psychological safety in the workplace. 

All our podcasts are free of charge from wherever you get your podcasts. You can even listen to our podcasts on the agileinaction.com website. 

Introducing transcripts

Now earlier I mentioned, I have a few big announcements. As if 10,000 viewers and a two year anniversary, weren't enough, we are excited to announce that we are providing a feature many of you have asked for, and that is transcriptions. Moving forward, when you go to a podcast on the agileinaction.com website, you will see the transcriptions for any new podcasts. And let's starting with the July 26 , 2022 podcast titled the leaders mindset required for organizational agility and that's with Dr. Thomas Grisham. 

Call for guests

Another announcement is that we are looking for guests that have a passion for organizational change, agility, team development, leadership, and modernization. If you are that person or know someone that is just send me an email at bill.raymond@agileinaction.com. 

That's bill.raymond@agileinaction.com, one word.
