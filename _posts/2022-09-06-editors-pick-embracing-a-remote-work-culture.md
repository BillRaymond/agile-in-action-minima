## Editor's pick!
In celebration of US Labor Day, we are taking the week off. We thought it would be fun to share this re-broadcast of Sarah Shewell's conversation about embracing remote work.

Listen as Bill and Sarah Shewell discuss how company culture and inclusion matter more than ever in the age of Zoom meetings and remote work. Sarah shares practical tactics she used to elicit cooperation, communication, and the flow of information among various teams.
